## Overview
Coin Purse is supposed to be a *virtual bank* for my Pathfinder character recording what they spend and what they spend it on and what the current balance of their account it. 

This is intended as a test bench for Python Flask programming, it has an sqlite database, migrations and a configuration file.

I'll document milestones here as I do them and my goals.

Got Pytest working... kinda, I had to put a fix into ``` __init__ ``` that shouldn't be necessary
